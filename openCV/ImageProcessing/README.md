Image processing is a analysis and manipulation on an image by performing some operations, in order to get an enhanced image and or to extract some useful information from it. 

Digital-image:
An image can be defined as a 3-D(colour images) or a 2-D matrix defined by function f(x,y) at any point which gives the pixel value at that point of an image. 

The pixel value describes how bright the pixel is and what color it stands for.

Image Processing includes:
Importing the image
Analysing the images
Manipulating or making changes to the images
Saving or Displayong the processed or manipulated image as output.

Computer does not visualise an image the way we do.
 It depends on pixel values as a image is made of pixels, the smallest unit holding information in an image.
 The pixel has a value ranging from 0-255 for RGB channels.
 The image is considered as a matrix of numbers (pixel values) of that particular locations.

 The operations that can be performed are:
 Resizing
 Cropping
 Filtering
